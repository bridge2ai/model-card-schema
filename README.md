# model-card-schema


A LinkML schema for the Model Cards model as published in [Model Cards for Model Reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993), which is an effort to democratize AI/ML technologies including increasing transparency. Model Cards represent information about trained machine learning models and can provide data on benchmarked model evaluations across a variety of conditions, including varying cultural, demographic, or phenotypic factors. Model Cards can also specify the applicable contexts for using the trained model and other relevant information.

This repository stores a LinkML schema representation for the original Model Cards model, representing the topics, sets of questions, and expectations about entities and fields expected in the answers (work in progress). [HuggingFace provides a markdown Model Card template](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/blob/main/src/huggingface_hub/templates/modelcard_template.md) and their are [JSON and Proto versions provided by the Model Card Toolkit](https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/model_card_toolkit/guide/concepts###schema).

The Google Model Card model is also supported by the Model Card Toolkit for creating Model Card instances for trained models [Introducing the Model Card Toolkit for Easier Model Transparency Reporting](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/introducing-model-card-toolkit-for.html). In addition HuggingFace has adopted Model Cards and has released a [Model Cart Writing Tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface/Model_Cards_Writing_Tool), Amazon AWS also has support for [Amazon SageMaker Model Cards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-cards.html) including creation of Model Card instances using the [SageMaker Python SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-cards-create.html), and Model Cards can also be generated via scikit-learn [How to create and deploy a model card in the cloud with Scikit-Learn](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/create-a-model-card-with-scikit-learn).
